Hereâ€™s a detailed tabular comparison of the data types you mentioned:  

| Data Type    | Example Code | Explanation | Purpose & Use Case |  
|-------------|-------------|-------------|---------------------|  
| **str** (String) | `x = str("Hello World")` | Stores a sequence of characters | Used for textual data like names, messages, etc. |  
| **int** (Integer) | `x = int(20)` | Stores whole numbers (positive, negative, or zero) | Used for counting, indexing, arithmetic operations, etc. |  
| **float** (Floating Point) | `x = float(20.5)` | Stores decimal numbers | Used in calculations requiring precision, like scientific computations or financial applications |  
| **complex** (Complex Number) | `x = complex(1j)` | Represents a number with a real and imaginary part | Used in advanced mathematical and engineering calculations |  
| **list** (List) | `x = list(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))` | Ordered, mutable collection | Used when you need a flexible, ordered collection of elements |  
| **tuple** (Tuple) | `x = tuple(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))` | Ordered, immutable collection | Used for fixed data structures like coordinates, database records |  
| **range** (Range) | `x = range(6)` | Represents a sequence of numbers | Used in loops for iteration (`for i in range(6)`) |  
| **dict** (Dictionary) | `x = dict(name="John", age=36)` | Key-value pairs (unordered) | Used for storing structured data like JSON, configurations |  
| **set** (Set) | `x = set(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))` | Unordered, unique elements | Used to store unique items and perform set operations |  
| **frozenset** (Frozen Set) | `x = frozenset(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))` | Immutable version of a set | Used when a set should not be modified |  
| **bool** (Boolean) | `x = bool(5)` | Represents `True` or `False` | Used for conditional checks (`if`, `while` loops) |  
| **bytes** (Bytes) | `x = bytes(5)` | Immutable sequence of bytes | Used for handling binary data like images, files |  
| **bytearray** (Byte Array) | `x = bytearray(5)` | Mutable sequence of bytes | Used when you need to modify binary data |  
| **memoryview** (Memory View) | `x = memoryview(bytes(5))` | Provides a view of a memory buffer | Used for handling large binary data efficiently without copying |
